Instructions for replicating robot: 
Comment: This is a set of instructions for wiring the robot and also to program the arduino. Structure of the robot isn't
currently provided. If so, an image file can be uploaded.

Wiring the robot:
See wiring diagram below. It will use an integrated ciruit wiring the dc motors and their respective digital pins to control 
both forwards and backwards. 2 servos are wired for the "scoop" that will be controlled by the ultrasonic sensor. The DC 
motors will be controlled by bluetooth control.

Coding the Robot:
Copy and paste Arduino Code in repository and uoload it to the arduino.
You will need to have an app built or use Arduino Bluetooth Control (for Android) to control the motors over blueooth.

You can go wherever with building the robot, as long as it has motors, servos, an ultrasonic sensor and a bluetooth module.
